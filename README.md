# videoCondenser
Edits videos down by 90% by taking short segments and blending them together.  Also generates a 'thumbnail' version in webm format. 

In my case this is used for post processing helmet cam video. 

Example output:

<video id="sampleMovie" src="images/ted_rosling_third_world_stats.mp4.webm" controls></video>
